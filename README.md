# Challenge 6: Weather App Challenge

[Deployment Link](

In this assignment, I created a weather app to search for 5-days forecasts.

When the user loads the page, they come to an input field to search for the weather in any city.

The top part of the page shows the current weather conditions of the searched cities, while the bottom part of the page shows the 5-day forecasts in different cards.

A button appears in the column "Searched Cities."  The buttons are saved and accumulate as new cities are searched.  When the user clicks on those buttons, they can return to the weather forecasts of those cities.

At the bottom of the page is a "Clear Search Items" button that deletes all previous searches from local storage.

This was definitely a very challenging assignment, especially getting the local storage set for each new button as it was generated through javascript, but my understanding of the language has been greatly enhanced as a result of doing it.
