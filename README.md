## Overview

In this coding bootcamp assignment, I created a weather forecast app with the Open Weather 3rd-party API to search for 5-day forecasts everywhere around the world.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Features

This app features a number of JavaScript methods and functions that were new to us in coding bootcamp.  The first and foremost of these was the fetch() method for retrieving data from a 3rd-party API.  This app also features dynamically rendered elements such as buttons when ceratin cities are searched, local storage functionality, as well as clearing local storage functionality.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Open Weather API

## Challenges

1. Getting the dynamically rendered buttons hooked up to local storage to retrieve the correct data set for that particular past search
2. Linking ```lat and lon``` with ```city names``` for searches
3. Understanding the dynamic creation of elements through JS
4. Completing this in a timely fashion while also working on our first group project

This was definitely a challenging assignment, but my understanding of JavaScript and its power of dynamic creation of elements have been greatly enhanced as a result of doing it.   

## Future Enhancements

1. Use customized icons
2. Add media queries for mobile responsiveness
3. Have UVI dynamically colored according to value (parseInt())
